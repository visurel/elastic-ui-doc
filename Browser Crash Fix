In Layout.component.ts

create 3 boolean variables for each toggling state

togglingSideNav:boolean;
togglingQuickPanel:boolean;
togglingSettings:boolean;

in the toggle functions, create an if statement to check if they are currently being toggled, and if not allow for the dispatch to occur
along with setting the toggling variable to true. This prevents multiple toggles from occuring before one has completed but still reacts just
as fast.

example:
toggleSideNav(){
  if(!this.togglingSideNav){
    this.togglingSideNav = true;
    this.store.dispatch(new layout.ToggleSidenavAction());
  }
}




The above is for toggling specifically. When resizing you may run into the same bug, as it skips toggling and directly opens/closes without
respect to it finishing its closing or opening. The fix is below:

Create a connection to the MatSideNav that contains the side-nav.
In layout.component.html
<mat-sidenav class="sidenav-container etc etc etc> 

include the #sidenav in order to reference it in layout.component.ts
so that it looks like
<mat-sidenav #sidenav class="sidenav-container etc etc etc> 

Then in layout.component.ts create a ViewChild

@ViewChild('sidenav') sideNavContainer: MatSidenav;

When resizing for mobile, simply check is the sidenav is already open or closed, then toggle if necessary.
Following code is located in the MediaReplayService code that checks for MediaChange, in layout.component.ts

if(this.layout === "gamma" && isMobile){
  this.closeSidenav();
  //OTHER CODE
 }
else if(isMobile){
  if(this.sideNavContainer.opened){this.toggleSideNav()}
  //OTHER CODE
}else{
  if(!this.sideNavContainer.opened){this.toggleSideNav()}
  //OTHER CODE
}
