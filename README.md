## Getting Started

In this section you will find the basic folder structure and everything you need to get the theme up and running the first time to start developing.

### Folder Structure

| Name                  | Description |
| -------------:        |---------------
| `.angular-cli.json`    | Used for configuration of project specific settings. You can add external styles and scripts, change the output folder, add assets, add environment files and more. |
| `e2e`                 | Will be used for end-to-end tests to ensure functionality for users before deploying.      |
| `node_modules`        | All external modules used are here. Do not mess with this folder, as it is auto-generated by using `npm install`.      |
| `package.json`        | Contains all dependencies used for production and development. |
| `src`                 | Contains all Angular 16 Typescript code, assets and basically everything the end user will have access to. |
| `tslint.json`         | Angular-CLI includes an automatic Typescript-Linter, which can be configured with this file. |

### Using Angular-CLI

Angular-CLI allows you to create a new App in a matter of seconds and provides an awesome way to generate scaffolds for basically all Angular 16-Components. [You can take a look at what commands are available here.](//github.com/angular/angular-cli#generating-components-directives-pipes-and-services)

In this article, we are going to install Angular-CLI and it's prerequisites and then generate our first project with a few various components.

---

### Prerequisites

Before we can install Angular-CLI we will have to get a few thing set up first. To run Angular-CLI we will need to install these 2 prerequisites first.

* **NodeJS** v4 or newer (we recommend v6 or newer)

[A detailed instruction on how to install NodeJS is available here.](//docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

---

### Installing Angular-CLI

Installing Angular-CLI is as simple as running this simple command:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`
or
`sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`

and the package manager `npm` will do the rest.

---

### Generating the first `Component`

Now that we have installed all prerequisites it's time to start developing our app. Angular-CLI offers a lot of assistance and allows you to generate basically all Angular 16-Components there are. *(In a smart way!)*

To generate our first `component` we simply open up a terminal and navigate in our Angular 16-App. Now we simply run `ng g component client` and we get a new component in `/src/app/client` with the following files:

* `client.component.ts`
* `client.component.html`
* `client.component.css`
* `client.component.spec.ts`

The files `client.component.ts` and `client.component.spec.ts` contain the most code, the other files only contain placeholders.

**client.component.ts**

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  moduleId: module.id,
  selector: 'app-client',
  templateUrl: 'client.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['client.component.css']
})
export class ClientComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
  }

}
```
By executing this short command, we just saved ourselves a lot of time creating all these `Component` files and boilerplate code.

[Syntax for all commands are available here.](//github.com/angular/angular-cli#generating-components-directives-pipes-and-services)

---

### Generating a Service in a specific folder

Now we have our `component`, but what if we want to share some data between components and need to create a `service` to manage this all. Well, we probably would want the service to be in the correct folder, probably right in the components folder in `/src/app/client`.

Either way, with Angular-CLI we can generate in any folder, wherever we want. Simply use the path *(relative to `/src/app/`)* and use it as the name of the generated component.

`ng g service client`
or
`ng g service client/shared`

Or anything you need.
Afterward we will find two generated files in our specified folder: `client.service.ts` and `client.service.spec.ts`.

**client.service.ts**
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class ClientService {

  constructor() { }

}
```
### Live-Preview and App-Start

Now that we have generated our components, we sure want to see how the result will look like. Luckily Angular-CLI comes pre-configured with a **Live Compile and Reload Server** for which you simply have to run `ng serve` and after a few seconds your site will be live at `http://localhost:4200`.


All changes you now make to your app will automatically be compiled and your open browser window will be reloaded.

These were the first steps with the awesome Angular-CLI and Angular 16. Following we are going to get more in detail about developing with Angular-CLI and using the power of Angular 16 right.

## Customizing

Everything shown in the demo can also be customized and most things are generated dynamically, for example the navigation menu.

### Add a Menu Item

Menu Items can be added from anywhere, but we recommend to define them in the route-handler component. Here's an example directly from our demo:
```typescript
// Top Level Item (The item to click on so the dropdown opens)
const dashboard = new SidenavItem({
  name: 'Dashboard',
  icon: 'dashboard',
  subItems: [ ],
  position: 1
});

// Sub Items for the Top Level Item (The items shown when you clicked on the dropdown item)
// Note: The Top Level Item is added as "parent" in those items, here "dashboard" (variable from above)
const dashboardSubItems = [
  new SidenavItem({
    name: 'All-In-One',
    route: '/',
    parent: dashboard,
    subItems: [ ],
    position: 1,
    routerLinkActiveOptions: {
      exact: true
    }
  }),
  new SidenavItem({
    name: 'Statistics Dashboard',
    route: '/dashboard/statistics',
    parent: dashboard,
    subItems: [ ],
    position: 1
  }),
  new SidenavItem({
    name: 'CRM Dashboard',
    route: '/dashboard/crm',
    parent: dashboard,
    subItems: [ ],
    position: 1
  }),
];

// Push the just created Sub Items into the Top Level Item
dashboard.subItems.push(...dashboardSubItems);

// Send the created Menu structure to Redux/ngrx (you only need to send the Top Level Item, all dropdown items will be added automatically)
this.store.dispatch(new sidenavAction.AddSidenavItemAction(dashboard));
```

### Receive, send and map data to a server with GET and POST requests

Receiving data from a server to process or display it in Angular 16 can be quite tricky with the new observables and syntax. Here you'll find an example how you can do this.

First of all create an abstract `BaseService` where you configure your Backend-URL and the correct paths for your backend.

**base.service.ts**
```typescript
import { Http, Headers } from '@angular/http';
import { Inject, Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';

@Injectable()
export abstract class BaseService {
  config: String;
  http:   Http;
  modelName: string;
  model: any;

  constructor(@Inject(Http) http: Http) {
    this.http   = http;
    this.config = 'http://yourBackend.url'
  }

  mapListToModelList (list: Array<Object>) {
    list.forEach((item, index) => {
      list[index] = this.mapModel(item);
    });

    return list;
  }

  mapModel(model: any) {
    return this.model(model);
  }

  findById(id: number, populate: Array<string> = null) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let url = this.config + '/' + this.modelName + '/' + id;

      if (populate) {
        url = url + '?populate=' + populate.join(', ');
      }

      console.log('URL', url);

      this.http.get(url)
        .map(res => res.json())
        .subscribe(res => {
          if (res.error) {
            reject(res.error);
          } else {
            resolve(this.mapModel(res));
          }
        });
    });
  }

  find(populate: Array<string> = null) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let url = this.config + '/' + this.modelName;

      if (populate) {
        url = url + '?populate=' + populate.join(', ');
      }

      this.http.get(url)
        .map(res => res.json())
        .subscribe(res => {
          if (res.error) {
            reject(res.error);
          } else {
            resolve(this.mapListToModelList(res));
          }
        });
    });
  }

  upsert(model: any) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let url = this.config + '/api/' + this.modelName;

      var headers = new Headers();
      headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');
      headers.append('Accept', 'application/json');

      this.http.put(url, JSON.stringify(model), {headers : headers})
        .map(res => res.json())
        .subscribe(res => {
          console.log(res);
          if (res.error) {
            reject(res.error);
          } else {
            resolve(this.mapModel(res));
          }
        });
    });
  }

  create(model: any) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let url = this.config + '/' + this.modelName;

      var headers = new Headers();
      headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');
      headers.append('Accept', 'application/json');

      this.http.post(url, JSON.stringify(model), {headers : headers})
        .map(res => res.json())
        .subscribe(res => {
          console.log(res);
          if (res.error) {
            reject(res.error);
          } else {
            resolve(this.mapModel(res));
          }
        });
    });
  }
}
```

Then you'll need a more specific service, in this example it's called `CustomerService`. This Service `extends` the `BaseService` inheriting all it's functions.

You will need to define a variable `modelName` which will appear in the called GET path in `BaseService`.

**customer.service.ts**
```typescript
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { Http } from "@angular/http";
import { BaseService } from "../../shared/base.service";
import { Customer } from "./customer.model";

@Injectable()
export class CustomerService extends BaseService {
  model: any;
  modelName = 'customer';

  constructor(@Inject(Http) http:Http) {
    super(http);

    this.model = (construct: any) => {
      return new Customer(construct);
    };
  }
}
```

Before using the data, you should map it as a class, so Typescript knows what it is and you know later on too.
This is a sample `Customer` class.

**customer.model.ts**
```typescript
export class Customer {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;

  constructor(model: any = null) {
    if (model) {
      this.firstName = model.firstName;
      this.lastName = model.lastName;
    }
  }
}
```

Last but not least you can finally inject the `CustomerService` and call one of these functions:
- `.find()` => GET to http://yourBackend.url/customer -> returns Array of Customers
- `.findById(1)` => GET to http://yourBackend.url/customer/1 -> returns single Customer Object
- `.create(model)` => POST to http://yourBackend.url/customer
- `.upsert(model)` => UPDATE to http://yourBackend.url/customer

**customer.component.ts**
```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { CustomerService } from "../shared/customer.service";
import { Customer } from "../shared/customer.model";

@Component({
  selector: 'app-customer',
  templateUrl: './customer.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./customer.component.css']
})
export class CustomerComponent implements OnInit {
  customers: Customer[] = [ ];

  constructor(private customerService: CustomerService) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.customerService.find().then((customers) => {
      this.customers = customers;
    });
  }
}
```

Note: You may need to adjust the `import` paths according to your directory structure.

### URL mapping on an Apache Server

To allow for the URL to automatically route to the appropriate component on an Apache server like the internal `ng serve` server, you need to create a .htaccess file that routes all requests to the `index.html` file.

Here is an example how we did it on our demo-page:
```.htaccess
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

Note: We're using https, if you don't have or need https, remove the `s` from `https://` and the `RewriteCond` with `%{HTTPS} off`.
